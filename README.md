ðŸŒˆ #Rainbow Safari
=============
Rainbow Safari is a small CSS file that allows you to change the color of the title bar on browsers like Safari on iOS and OSX.

_In current versions of safari the trick only works if you have scrolled down a little._

All code you need can be found in `css/rainbowsafari.css`. Add this to your website and you're done. No HTML required.
